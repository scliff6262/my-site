          Hi, my name is Sean Clifford and I am a recent graduate of the Flatiron School.
          After spending several years working as a manager in multiple bars/restaurants and as an account executive in the public relations realm,
          I decided to take a dive into the tech industry. After learning about how software is built,
          I began to realize how powerful code can be and its unlimited creative potential. Code is used everywhere for, seemingly, everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          This realization led me to make a full time commitment to learning code, ultimately enrolling in the Flatiron School.
          Now, after completing several of my own projects,
          I am itching to further my coding knowledge and bring my skillset to a larger, and more collaborative project.
          Seeing what I have already been able to build has me very excited to keep learning and growing in this industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than creating software, I love talking sports (mostly football and soccer),
          traveling and just meeting new and interesting people.
